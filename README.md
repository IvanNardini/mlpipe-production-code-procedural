# A quick project about Writing Production Code for ML Deployment via Procedural Approach

This project is just the first part focused on How to write code for Model deployment. 

The purpose is getting my hands dirty with its key principles and challenges I learn from Deployment of Machine Learning Model on Udemy. In particular, I’ll attempt to highlight advantages and disadvantages for each of best practices I cover.

## The Scenario

To make things easier, I sample the Kaggle’s Fraud Claim Detection based on the Auto Insurance Claims Data.

In particular, I try to replicate at OmkarReddy and Bunty Shah user’s notebooks.

Below the **high-level architecture of the project**:
